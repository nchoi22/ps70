### About Me

<img src="./solo_shot.png" class="img-rounded" alt="noa-pic" width="200" height="200">


My name is Noa Choi, a senior at Harvard College studying Physics! I'm very interested in space, and will be working in aerospace and defense after I graduate. I'm coming into this class with some experience in making different sensors work together and communicate, but not enough experience in building things from scratch, so I'm really excited to learn more about various design and fabrication methods. Some of my hobbies and interests include puzzles (jigsaw puzzles and Rubik's cubes), biking, soccer, and science-fiction!
