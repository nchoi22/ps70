  <h3>Week 2: 2D Cutting and Design</h3><br>
</div>


<xmp style="display:none;">
<br> 

This week, we were tasked with familiarizing ourselves with the laser cutter by creating a press-fit construction kit out of cardboard, as well as learning how to model in Fusion 360 by following an online tutorial and modeling household/lab components.

## Press-Fit Construction Kit

Creating a press-fit construction kit offered my first foray into computer aided design (CAD) using Fusion 360. We were tasked to make press-fit pieces of cardboard that could be assembled in multiple ways, so I decided to start with a polygon to keep things simple. After seeing examples of kits made with triangles, squares, and hexagons, I decided to make pentagons with notches on each side, as I couldn't intuitively imagine what sorts of structures could come out of pentagons coming together. The process started with creating a 2D sketch of my pentagon, setting user parameters on Fusion 360 for the pentagon's side length, notch depth, kerf, etc. The starting parameters are shown below.

## Fusion 360 Tutorials and Modeling

Next, I moved on to following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc&ab_channel=CADCAMTutorials">CADCAM's</a> Fusion 360 tutorial to learn more about 2D modeling and get introduced to 3D modeling. These tutorials solidified skills I had already gained while building the press-fit kit, taught new skills, and cleared up confusions I had previously. For example, I was previously not as clear as to when a sketch element, like a line or shape, is "fully defined", or how to use all the various kinds of constraints. I was also confused as to why adding certain constraints created "driven constraints".
