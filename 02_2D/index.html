  <h3>Week 2: 2D Cutting and Design</h3><br>
</div>


<xmp style="display:none;">
<br> 

This week, we were tasked with familiarizing ourselves with the laser cutter by creating a press-fit construction kit out of cardboard, as well as learning how to model in Fusion 360 by following an online tutorial and modeling household/lab components.

## Press-Fit Construction Kit

Creating a press-fit construction kit offered my first foray into computer aided design (CAD) using Fusion 360. We were tasked to make press-fit pieces of cardboard that could be assembled in multiple ways, so I decided to start with a polygon to keep things simple. After seeing examples of kits made with triangles, squares, and hexagons, I decided to make pentagons with notches on each side, as I couldn't intuitively imagine what sorts of structures could come out of pentagons coming together. The process started with creating a 2D sketch of my pentagon, setting user parameters on Fusion 360 for the pentagon's side length, notch depth, kerf, etc. The starting parameters are shown below.

## Fusion 360 Tutorials and Modeling

Next, I moved on to following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc&ab_channel=CADCAMTutorials">CADCAM's</a> Fusion 360 tutorial to learn more about 2D modeling and get introduced to 3D modeling. These tutorials solidified skills I had already gained while building the press-fit kit, taught new skills, and cleared up confusions I had previously. For example, I was previously not as clear as to when a sketch element, like a line or shape, is "fully defined", or how to use all the various kinds of constraints. I was also confused as to why adding certain constraints created "driven constraints". Following these tutorials and examples, I was able to understand these concepts and practice building more interesting shapes using sketch dimensions, trimming, and most of the constraints. A couple examples are shown below:

    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>

I also followed CADCAM's tutorial on creating 3D objects, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBJMgkzkaas&t=633s&ab_channel=LarsChristensen">Lars Christensen's</a> tutorial on the difference between components, bodies, and assemblies in Fusion 360. From CADCAM's tutorials, I learned how to make basic 3D models, using techniques like press-pull, extrusion cuts into existing objects, joining two objects together, working in different planes for various parts of the object, and more. I also learned how to add color to an object at the end of the process. These were very helpful in getting myself familiarized with working Fusion 360 as a whole, and was really helpful in building out my own model (more on that below). An example of an object I made during these tutorials is shown below:

<img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/tutorial_3d.png" alt="tutorial3d">

From Lars Christensen's tutorial, I learned that within the same build file on Fusion 360, you can create individual components that can be build separately, and later put together in assembly. This was very helpful in my mini modeling project, which I'll get into now!

For my personal modeling task, I decided to model components of one of my favorite things, the Rubik's cube. To keep things simple for now, I decided to model just the core of the cube and a center side piece. The interior view of a Rubik's cube is shown below; I wanted to model simplified versions of the white core inside the cube and a center piece that connects to the core.

<img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/cube_interior.png" alt="cubeinterior">

I started by creating two separate components in my Fusion 360 file, with one named "Core" and the other named "Center". Starting with the core, I decided to make a simple model of 6 intersecting pipes. I started by extruding a circle (diameter given by measured user parameters) along an axis and centering it at the origin. Next, I created an offset plane, such that I could create another circle to extrude on that plane directly. When extruding this second circle, I had it extrude outwards a given distance (based on measurements and parameters) and inwards towards the existing cylinder. I had this new cylinder be "joined" to the first cylinder. This process is shown in the two images below:

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/offset_plane.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3"> 
      <img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/offset_extrude.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>

I then used the "Circular Pattern" on this new extruded cylinder to wrap it around the first cylinder, giving me a full set of intersecting pipes that resemble my core:

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/circular_pipe.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/6pipe.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>

Using a very similar process, I created extrusion cuts to create the holes inside each pipe, which led to my final core design:

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/circle_extrude.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/final_core.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>

Next, I worked on the Center, which was a separate component. I could toggle the core I made in and out of view, which made for a good reference to know where to create my center piece such that they fit together in my model. My center model was simplified to be a thin cylinder that fits inside a hole in the core, a larger cylinder that rests on top of the core, both of which are connected to a rectangular prism. This process was simple, as I just built each 3D shape one by one, using offset planes to get them started at the right place. This is shown in these images below:

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/center_build.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/02_2D/pics/center_final.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>





Dimensions of the core and center piece were measured using a caliper, and inputted as user parameters in Fusion 360, which are shown below.
