## Assignment:

This week, we were tasked with creating our own capacitive sensor to measure some physical quantity, and calibrating this and another sensor of our choosing. For the second sensor, I chose the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.

### Capacitive Sensing

I decided to create a simple capacitive sensor that can detect the distance a human hand is from the sensor, and use this information to control how many LED's are lit up on an LED strip. The basic setup for this is shown below:

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/cap_sense_setup1.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>

In this initial physical setup, we see a copper sheet serving as one end of our capacitor, and a human hand being help above it would serve as the other end. The Arduino Uno is also connected to an LED strip with 10 nodes, and this strip is upright against a wall of styrofoam. The two pieces of styrofoam that hold the copper sheet and the LED strip are simply held together with toothpicks in this initial setup. [A schematic for the circuit will be added shortly].

The idea is that the distance from the copper sheet to my hand will map to how many LED's should light up (i.e. any LED below my hand level should be turned on). This way, I could control the LED strip without touching anything! 

Arduino Libraries: <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/">CapacitiveSensor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel">Adafruit_NeoPixel</a>

Materials: Copper sheet, 10MOhm resistor, wires, 10-node LED strip, Arduino Uno, 1kOhm resistor

After setting up the circuit and basic code, I attempted an initial calibration. To do so, I measured the distance between each LED on the strip (1.7cm) and set up markers on the side of the physical setup to represent different heights above the copper sheet in increments of 1.7cm. This is shown below:

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/cap_sense_cali.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>

Then, I noted down the (roughly) average sensor readings that correspond to what height my hand was at, and created a plot using MATLAB:

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/cap_cal_1.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>

The plot shows both sensor readings vs. hand position, as well as the baseline sensor reading without the hand above. We see some problems here - the sensor loses sensitivity FAST as the hand position rises, and it's very hard to distinguish between heights from ~10cm-17cm as the sensor readings are all very close together. The overall curve resembles an exponential decay. Another issue found was that the ambient baseline sensor output (shown in red) varied a lot, and overall our sensor output signal was quite noisy. Some potential solutions to try:
grounding the Arduino board, use a larger resistor (>10Mohm) to increase sensitivity, adding a small capacitor in parallel to stabilize sensor readings.

I will need to take into account these results to change my circuitry for more sensitive and stable readings, and implement better code to have the system do what I want it to do. The current state of the code, which has the basic shell of what the program will do, is shown below. After better calibration is achieved, the void led_update() function will be modified to map sensor readings to a physical height, and then to the number of LEDs that should be lit up. 

#### Code:

<pre><code>

#include CapacitiveSensor.h
#include Adafruit_NeoPixel.h


CapacitiveSensor   cs_7_5 = CapacitiveSensor(7,5);        // 10 megohm resistor between pins 7 & 5, pin5 is sensor pin, add wire, foil

#define PIN        9 
#define NUMPIXELS 10 
#define DELAYVAL 500 // Time (in milliseconds) to pause between pixels

// define NeoPixel strip object
Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

// define global variables
long current_sensor_val = 0;
unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
int current_led = 0;
const int tol = 100;
int diff = 0;
const int max = 700

void setup()                    
{

  strip.begin(); // INITIALIZE NeoPixel strip object
  strip.show();            // Turn OFF all pixels ASAP
  strip.setBrightness(10); // Set BRIGHTNESS low to reduce draw (max = 255)

  cs_7_5.set_CS_AutocaL_Millis(0xFFFFFFFF);     // turn off autocalibrate on channel 1 - just as an example

  strip.clear(); // Set all pixel colors to 'off' 

  

  // The first NeoPixel in a strand is #0, second is 1, all the way up
  // to the count of pixels minus one.
  for(int i=0; i < NUMPIXELS; i++) { // For each pixel...

    // strip.Color() takes RGB values, from 0,0,0 up to 255,255,255
    // Here were using a moderately bright green color:
    strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(0, 150, 0));

    strip.show();   // Send the updated pixel colors to the hardware.

    delay(DELAYVAL); // Pause before next pass through loop
  }

  Serial.begin(9600);

}

void led_update(long sensor, long current_val, int diff) {



}

void loop()                    
{
  

    //long start = millis();
    long total =  cs_7_5.capacitiveSensor(30);

    diff = total - current_sensor_val;

    if (abs(diff) > tol) {
      led_update(total,current_sensor_val,diff);
    }

    //Serial.print(millis() - start);        // check on performance in milliseconds
    //Serial.print("\t");                    // tab character for debug window spacing

    //Serial.println(total);                  // print sensor output 1

    delay(10);                             // arbitrary delay to limit data to serial port 
}

### Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04

Next, I decided to try out and calibrate the ultrasonic sensor HC-S404, imaged below.

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/ultra.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>

This ultrasonic sensor emits a 40kHz frequency sound wave, which bounces off an object in front of it to return to the receiver. Thus, using the speed of sound and the time it took for the signal to come back to the sensor, the distance of the object in front of it can be estimated. I tried calibrating the sensor by first collecting sensor data at fixed distances from the sensor (note: the distances were measured using a ruler starting at the front edge of the emitter and receiver of the sensor). The figure below shows the relationship of sensor readings vs. the actual distance, for distances ranging from 0-30cm.

<div class="container-fluid bg-3 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <img src="/ps70/ultrasonic_graph.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image"></a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div><br>

For disances under 3cm, we see some strange behavior where the sensor is actually reading higher distances than the real value, meaning there is a lower bound on where the sensor is accurate. Afterwards, there is a fairly clean linear relationship between the sensor readings and the actual distance. However, the sensor readings are very consistently about 1cm shorter than the actual distance. Since the actual distance is measured from the very front edge of the sensor, this would not be an error from the ruler placement. Thus, it may be a good rule of thumb to perform sensor tests like this, find the average offset from the true distance, and account for this in the reporting of sensor values.

const int trigPin = 5;
const int echoPin = 18;

long duration;
float distanceCm;
float distanceInch;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); // Starts the serial communication
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT); // Sets the trigPin as an Output
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT); // Sets the echoPin as an Input
}

void loop() {
  // Clears the trigPin
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  // Sets the trigPin on HIGH state for 10 micro seconds
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  
  // Reads the echoPin, returns the sound wave travel time in microseconds
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  
  // Calculate the distance
  distanceCm = duration * SOUND_SPEED/2;
  
  // Convert to inches
  distanceInch = distanceCm * CM_TO_INCH;
  
  // Prints the distance in the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("Distance (cm): ");
  Serial.println(distanceCm);
  Serial.print("Distance (inch): ");
  Serial.println(distanceInch);
  
  delay(1000);
}
