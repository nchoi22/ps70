#### Week 1: Final Project Ideas 

This week, we were tasked with getting our website up and running and generating final project ideas. I'm coming in to this course interested in space, physics, and puzzles, and would like to have a final project related to one or more of these areas. 

## Puzzles

One project idea is to create a "smart" Rubik's cube. When going through a solve of the cube, the cube would collect data from the solve (time taken to solve, number of moves, turns per second, etc), and be connected wirelessly to an app or website to send, visualize, and store this data. This would be used as a training tool for improving my cubing. This type of project would augment the experience that I have when solving the cube, and would be a very challenging project. 

Another project idea could serve a more functional use: an visual Rubik's cube stand. I have a lot of puzzles, and they tend to not be very organized. I think creating a cool stand or mechanism for displaying and organizing my cubes could be a fun project, especially if paired with a visual aspect. To accomodate all the different kinds of puzzles I have, I could make a system of rotating shelves, potentially each with their own "charlieplexed" set of LEDs for visual displays. I could even create a 3D array of LEDs (for example, in a cube shape) that could create visual patterns that resemble cube puzzles, cube movements, or visualize sounds (like music). 

## Physics/Engineering

I'm also interested in projects related to my engineering interests, such as creating control systems that can do difficult tasks like balancing a ball on a plate. I'm also interested in the future of space manufacturing, so another potential project could include the autonomous construction of some small structure. These ideas are much less fleshed out, however, and will be given more thought in the coming days.
