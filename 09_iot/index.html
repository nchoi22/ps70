  <h3>Week 9: IoT and Radio</h3><br>

#### Assignment

This week, we were assigned with working with a partner or a group of 3 to program one or more microcontroller(s) to obtain and respond to information from the internet or radio, with at least one input and one output device.

Unfortunately, this was the week that I had COVID-19, and I was unable to partner up with anybody for this assignment. Thus, I attempted this assignment for the remote control part of my <a href="https://nchoi22.github.io/ps70/15_finalproject/index.html">final project</a> (which later was removed from the final project).

The goal was to have two ESP32S2 microcontrollers communicate with one another via radio, such that button inputs from one ESP could trigger motor movements on a NEMA17 stepper motor on the other ESP.

I first tried to do this using the LoRa RFM95W radio modules. These modules are a popular choice for long-range radio communication. I spent some time soldering wires to these modules, as shown below, and trying to connect the modules to the ESP32S2. However, I was not able to get the two microcontrollers talking, likely because I was not using the SPI communication protocol properly.

    </div>
  </div>

At this point, I switched over to the ESP_NOW protocol, which allows two ESP microcontrollers to communicate with one another on a 2.4GHz frequency without any external radio modules.
